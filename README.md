# MyCard
## A proof-of-concept card management app, built in ~4 weeks for the University of Otago SENG301 course.

This Android application was built in around 4 weeks by a group of 4 students, being myself (Charlie Hard), Emily McConnachie, Emily Strang, and Terry Liu. The aim of the project was to produce a technical solution to an everyday personal inconvenice. We decided to target bus card credit management, and set about building the app.

While we were required to produce an app, it was expected that it would not be fully featured. This is due to the focus of the course being more towards the software engineering processes of requirements gathering, scoping, etc. rather than the development itself. With that being said, we were able to produce a solid Android app with some caveats.

Note the app is backed by an SQLite DB instead of a networked alterative; this is in the interests of time and reducing project complexity. This was an enjoyable project! It was great to work with such a lively team and was a good way to dip my toes into Android development.

Due to the project's nature as a group effort, I did not produce all of the code myself. However, I was largely in charge of bug fixing (among a fair few other things) and so got to familiarise myself with the codebase fairly well. I'd be happy to try explain anything that needs explaining; just flick me an email at charlesdmhard@gmail.com.
